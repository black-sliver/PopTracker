# Plug-In License Addendum

We believe a user should be free to use any plug-in, regardless of license, as long as
1. the plug-in specification / API is open and compatible to both PopTracker's license and the plug-in's license,
   for example in a separate repository licensed under MIT,
2. the plug-in does not embed any PopTracker code at compile-time,
3. the plug-in is not required for PopTracker to function and
4. the plug-in is installed separately.

If this is found to be incompatible to GPLv3, this shall be an exception to PopTracker's license.

To avoid edge cases, it is preferred to ship plug-ins as separate executables that communicate with PopTracker,
with all communication defined in an external, license-compatible specification.

Plug-ins that are fully license-compatible do not fall under those restrictions.
